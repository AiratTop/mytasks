# MyTasks Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 28, 2025_

MyTasks is a fully offline task manager. We designed the app so that your data never leaves your device. This policy describes how the app handles information.

## Data Collection
- MyTasks does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
- There are no analytics SDKs, crash reporters, advertising networks, or telemetry services embedded in the app.

## Local Storage
- All tasks, preferences, and theme selections are stored locally on your device using the platform's secure storage APIs.
- Removing the app from your device deletes all stored data. Reinstalling the app starts with a clean slate.

## Network Access
- MyTasks works entirely offline. It does not access the internet, sync data to servers, or communicate with third parties.

## Third-Party Services
- The app does not integrate with any external services or APIs. There is no account system and no cloud storage.

## Children’s Privacy
- Because no data is collected, MyTasks is safe for all ages. The app does not contain content targeted at children, and it does not gather information from anyone under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy
- If the behavior of the app ever changes, we will update this document and provide the revision date above.
