# MyTasks

![MyTasks – Private Todo](https://github.com/AiratTop/mytasks/blob/main/assets/icon/icon.png)

MyTasks is a fast, offline-first task manager focused on instant capture and completion of personal todos. It keeps every task on-device, so nothing is sent to external services and the experience stays private by design.

### Highlights

- ⚡️ **Zero-friction capture** — a single-field bottom sheet lets you add tasks in one motion while blocking duplicates.
- 🔐 **Local persistence** — tasks are stored with `shared_preferences`, survive restarts, and never leave the device.
- ✅ **Inline completion** — every item shows a single checkbox; once checked, the task disappears from the list.
- 🌓 **Theme control** — the app follows the system theme but also exposes a quick toggle in the toolbar for manual switching.

## Getting Started

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run        # pick simulator, emulator, or Chrome
```

### Tests

```bash
flutter test
```
